<h1>Mitigating Corporate information exposure on the web </h1>

<article>

<p>Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web can be split into three
	key fields; risk detection, risk management and development of working solutions.
	Each of these factors provides a useful insight into prevention of corporate security
	breaches, both from the company’s perspective and the user’s perspective.

<p>Perhaps the most important step in mitigating corporate information exposure is
	the detection of any security flaws existing within a company’s system. A lack of
	standardized methods for risk assessment causes security measures to vary between
	companies and between practitioners. As a result different risk assessment models
	have been produced. Information Security Risk Assessment based its conceptual design
	on the analysis of generic methodologies, including CRAMM, CORAS and OCTAVE, by
	comparing the common features of each; as well as continually researching into different
	models to further develop its design. (Shamala, 2013, p45-52).

<p>Whereas more specific models propose that security controls should be selected
	based on real risks to an organization's assets and operations (Joshi, 2017).
	This study was aimed at reducing the risk of security breach in a University
	system by identifying weak points, prioritizing exploitations and improving
	security as an ongoing process in this shifting environment. However, even in
	this specific study, use of a standardized approach was maintained through a
	Common Vulnerability Scoring System which merged severity, maturity and frequency
	of a potential exploit to produce a quantitative risk level (Keramati, 2016).
	Furthermore, the National Vulnerability Database was used in this case to provide
	the references for advisories, solutions, and tools for the model. As well as showing
	flaws and exploits of a system recorded against risk and updated in real time (NVD, 2000).

<p>Successful management of security problems is another way to mitigate information
	exposure on the web. This approach covers appropriate strategies for action once a
	risk is detected and the testing that flaws have been fully resolved in a proposed
	solution. Similar to risk identification, risk management systems can follow an
	Information Structure Risk Management model, creating evidence-based decisions
	for security practitioners by integrating the quality of information assessment (Shamala, 2017).
	In this case, testing is used both to identify flaws and to test for possible solutions. P
	enetration testing, described as the type of testing whereby testers attempt to
	circumvent the security features of a system in an effort to identify security weaknesses,
	(Russell, 1993) detects any unauthorised network access through simulation of tactics used
	 by hackers, by the testers. An advantage of using penetration testing is the specific
	 feedback reported to the company rather than more generic recommendation (Penetration Testing, 2017),
	 which can be used to scale vulnerability of a system to specific risks and budget for an individual company.

<p>However, management of problems is only useful once a specific problem has been
	identified, with standardardized action here of less importance than during risk
	identification. A potential risk of buffer overruns, for example, could be identified
	through destructively testing inputs of Web Software, but resulting actions change
	depending on the severity of the security breach. Buffer Overruns can lead to information
	DoS, loss of data, or data corruption through overflowing a buffer with malicious code,
	if a user has knowledge of precise memory addresses of out of buffer instructions (Ash, 2003).
	Solutions include limiting the size of data inputs, ensuring code with administrator privileges
	is not being run and regularly changing the SQL database password/renaming the administrator
	account. Likewise, access to restricted directories by embedding URL’s in a parser
	should be prevented through proper practice, following the standard of documenting
	what information is passed as it relates to the feature; this allows for a solution
	to be equally effective independently of the severity of URL canonicalization.
	A common example of under management of security problems is preventing references
	to parsers with full stops (Ash, 2003) - which is not the only way to reference outside the parser’s domain.

<p>Development of working solutions to prevent information exposure has evolved
	rapidly over the last decade. It is important that these solutions keep up with
	the complexity of security attacks to mitigate information exposure, but the main
	focus should remain on detecting these adapting attacks. Use of encryption - basic
	technology enabling secure messaging (O’Neill, 2003) - has widely improved from symmetric
	encryption to more complex asymmetric encryption techniques, such as the RSA algorithm,
	because of the decreasing time required for a computer to process a brute-force attack.
	Symmetric encryption shares a private key between receiver and sender, initially of a
	Data Encryption Standard 64 bits, but later enhanced to block and key lengths  of 128,
	192 or 256 bits under the Advanced Encryption Standard (Proll, 2006, p256-258).
	Whereas asymmetric encryption uses different keys, a public key for encrypting and
	a private key for decrypting. Although theoretically more secure, asymmetric encryption
	requires reliable distribution of public keys under web application scenarios. To combat
	this, Registration Authorities have been established to provide certificates for distributors.
	Each certificate has a validity period, with untrustworthy certificates not being renewed,
	instead being held in Certificate Revocation Lists (Proll, 2006, p 260). Authentication of a
	user’s information over a communication medium has been further secured through use of digital
	signatures. These are unique hashes created from a user’s input data, therefore any change to the
	data will result in completely changing the hash - allowing for malicious alteration of data to be traced.

<p id = "last">In order to successfully mitigate corporate information exposure on
	the web it is crucial to investigate all aspects of a company’s information security.
	This includes use of models and simulations to highlight and combat potential risks,
	high-level testing of implemented solutions (to identified flaws or in an event of a
	security breach), and constant updating of risk-management protocols for staff and
	system on the company side. As well this, securing held information, input transmission
	and providing system access levels on the user-side prevents external exploitation of a
	company’s system. Out of these factors, arguably the most important for mitigating
	information exposure on the web are the methods used for identifying any real-time
	risks to a company’s information.
