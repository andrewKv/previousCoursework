<h3>Setting up an individual Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>To begin with the virtual machine was provided by google with each student
	given an individual account from the university email system. Beforehand I had
	only used window OS virtual machines so when LINUX opened I initially thought
	it had crashed when the input password cursor wasn’t blinking. However once this
	was resolved setting up the virtual machine was a simple case of following given instructions.

<h3>Receiving initial coursework</h3>
<p>Initially I created a separate google drive folder for the coursework, as well
as for the Web fundamentals unit. This was because my previous course directories
 were local to my laptop - streamlining accessibility. I then formatted the document
 and started initial research - this research covered the use of books within the library
 then, after I decided to more specifically focous on reading academic articles, the use of
 discovery to filter previous research into the topic.
Initial search terms began with;

<p class = "tabbed">Information exposure on the web
<p>This was too broad, so including terms;
	<ul>
		<li>Corporate
		<li>Mitigating
	</ul>

<p>allowed for academic articles to be found using discovery,
	in turn this linked to further academic research e.g. the theory behind the risk modelling paper.


<h3>Choosing an editor</h3>
<p>Suggested text editors were based on the capability of the software.
	These included editors such as Atom, Brackets, Notepad++, Sublime Text, WebStorm.
	 I started here by downloading the Atom text editor, although I could not yet
	 comprehensively test it until we began web development. Once started, I stuck
	  with atom for its ease of use, either through auto-completing or showing all
		files available in the directory.


<h3>Practicing academic writing</h3>
<p>To practice writing I was given the task of going back over a piece of prior work
	in order to change the words and sentence structure to fit in with writing used within
	the practical document.
<h4>Before:</h4>
<p>The first PDP’s (Programmed Data Processor) were marketed from 1957 - 1969;
	with many still in use in the late 70’s1. During this time of development,
	DEC (the Digital Equipment Corporation) would focus design of the PDP away from
	 large, complicated, and expensive computers that were typical of the time and
	 towards smaller, cheaper, minicomputers which appealed to a market unable to
	 afford these larger computers. As a result, these machines were marketed separately
	  from computers, selling for approximately 1/10 of the cheapest computer alternative.
<h4>After:</h4>
<p>The first Programmed Data Processors were marketed from 1957 - 1969; with multiple devices
	remaining in use during late 70’s1. During this time of development, the
	Digital Equipment Corporation would focus design of the PDP away from
	complicated and expensive computers that were typical of the time towards cheaper,
	compact, ‘mini computers’ which appealed to a market of reduced budget. As
	a result these machines were marketed independently from market computers,
	selling for approximately 1/10 of the cheapest computer alternative.

<h3 id = "htmlToCss">Linking CSS</h3>
<p>This can be done in the same file, or more effectively as a separate file enclosed
in style tags. A separate file does not need html style tags as it is a CSS file,
it is linked to the HTML by link rel="stylesheet" title="My Style" href="mystyle.css".
Class selectors use .notation to link classes from a CSS file to a HTML file,
whereas id selectors select different elements of a CSS file by their id. I used this
knowledge when validating my website to fix a case of duplicate ID's, as an ID should be unique
to an element on a particulart page, when styling list items I switched to using class
notation.


<h3 id = "images">Using images</h3>
<p>The image tag can be used to specify a file, height, width and style of an image.
	 It is necessary to include an alt option in the tag - which is displayed if the
	 designated image file cannot be loaded. Captions can also be used to border an
	 image using the figure element.
<p>
	<figure>
	 <picture>
		 <source type = "image/png" srcset = "images/pictureDemoImg.png"/>
		 <source type = "image/jpg" srcset = "images/pictureDemoImg.jpg"/>
	 	 <img src = "images/pictureDemoImg.gif" title = "Picture element" alt = "HTML picture example" />
	 </picture>
	 <figcaption>Setting multiple sources and captions</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>Picture elements can be used to provide a context for the browser about the image
	shown, img is still used as the point of reference where a style can be applied.
	In effect, this allows the browser to select different images and scale image sizes
	based on properties within a browser.

<p>Multiple source srcset tags can be used to display different images in order
	of precedence to suit browser compatibility - img tags will always be the last source to be
	defined. Image source can also be changed, not just changing the image quality.


<p>SVG tags (Scalable Vector Graphics) can be used for simple images and graphs.
	The tags mark out coordinate drawing elements as well as including text, links and
	transformation attributes. This may be useful for me as an alternative to using multiple reolsutions
	of the same image, i.e. if I wanted to include the University logo in different positions/ sizes on
	my website.


<h3>Using Video</h3>
<p>The video element can be used to displays videos with reference to alternative format support
	 the same way as the picture elements.


<h3 id = "research">Researching into useful HTML tags</h3>

<p>I found many different tags for displaying text, all with slightly different applications;
	these included: main, article, span, section, nav and footer tags. Furthermore, using margin and index styles
	in CSS is a more useful alternative than using a procedural format to set out these text elements
	and could adapt to screen size with units like viewport width(vw) and viewport height(vh).

<p>I also found a button tag, which fully implements a button object, this could save a lot of time, so
	I considered using buttons for in-page navigation for the discovery log and for a drop-down
	navigation for future pages that would not fit on the main navigation bar. After testing, I found it easier
	to create my own button element, this could be applied to links for navigation and validate
	successfully.

<h3>Accessibility considerations </h3>

<p> Upon researching of the button tag's applications, I found that the blue outline on
	 activation was important for disabled users to tab through buttons with a keyboard and see what
	 button they were up to. As a result I set this outline to none when active, but kept it to default
	 blue when a user tabbed through the page

<h3> Validation Concerns </h3>
<p> After using the w3 validator on my homepage I discovered that my nav bar had duplicate
	id selectors, to fix this I ended researching into class selector - to be applied to each
	list item. This resulted in the colour being overridden by the general anchor colour, to fix this
	I used the !important command in CSS to prevent the browser from ovveriding an element with a
	generic style.

<h3>Researching into CSS grid design and layout options in HTML</h3>

<p>A grid layout allows definitive layouts for the user that fixes design and section positions.
	This reduces the issue of a reduction of screen size causing unpredictability within the webpage elements

<p>Layout can also be different, depending on source, e.g. portrait or landscape orientation
<a href = "https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#track-sizing">https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#track-sizing</a>

<p>A grid can be set by setting the display to grid in CSS.
	The grid class contains arguments for in-line grid, grid column gap, grid row gap and grid - gap

<h3 id = "links">Researching into links and colours</h3>
<p>Linking to different web pages was fundamental for creating the website, this was
	achieved using a href element referencing the destination file.
<p>I used the HTML colour picker tool on the w3c site to determine exact
	hexadecimal values for the colours of my website. I then decided to set an
	image as a background for my homepage. This was done through CSS, I looked
	into setting the image in the centre of the page and scaling the image so
	it was visible on all screen sizes without duplicating the image. For images,
	a coordinate system can be used to place images in specific places.


<h3>Website design and usability</h3>
<p>To draw out a basic website design it was suggested to use FrameBox: <a href = "http://framebox.org/">http://framebox.org/</a>
		<figure>
			<picture>
				<source type = "image/png" srcset = "images/pageDesignDemo.png"/>
				<source type = "image/jpg" srcset = "images/pageDesignDemo.jpg"/>
				<img src = "images/pageDesignDemo.gif" title = "Page Layout" alt = "HTML picture example"/>
			</picture>
			<figcaption> Designing a page layout </figcaption>
		</figure>

<p>This will help me to plan page designs and interconnections between these pages,
	instead of diving straight into adding html.

<p>Usability was also a factor, in terms of screen size, resolution and screen
	orientation being programmed for by using media queries. Another idea this gave
	me was further extendability, e.g. dropdown menus, having the main website as a simplistic design.
	I used media queries to determine the device using the height of the device instead of the width,
	so the different version of the page would load depending on the type of the device. This allowed a changing
	width to affect each device smoothly.
